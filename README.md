What I'm most excited about: 

The concept of having a "structure" inside of a computer is very interesting to me.
I enjoy problem solving and finding the best way of doing things, so making code efficient
seems like it would be a great next step for me improving my abilities. I am also excited to improve upon my
limited C++ abilities, and become a better well-rounded programmer.
